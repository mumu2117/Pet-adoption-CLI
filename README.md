# PetAdoptions

Pet_Adoptions helps you find your new buddy by displaying adoptable buddies/animals at the Best Friends Animals Society (http://bestfriends.org/adopt/adopt-our sancturay). I have adopted about 6 pets in the past most of them Puppy Mill rescues and, three of them are still with me. It breaks my heart to see all these animals that need homes while people spend thousands of dollars on finding their perfect dog. All dogs are perfect in my opinion. Hopefully this will help spread to word to adopt and not buy. 

This gem helps scrape details of aniamls as well as each animal the user chooses from the best friends animal website.
